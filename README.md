# Time Series Forecasting with Prophet 

This [app](https://time-series-prophet.streamlit.app/) aims to make time series forecasting more accessible. It uses Facebook's [Prophet forecasting procedure](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to model any time series data uploaded by the user. Demo data (daily pageviews of Saturday Night Live's Wikipedia page) can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/andrewabeles/prophet/blob/main/SNL-wikipedia-pageviews-2022-2024.csv). The model parameters can be adjusted in the app's sidebar.
